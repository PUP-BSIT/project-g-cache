Settings API Integration - Changes Summary

Integrated frontend Settings Service with backend Settings API for persistent user settings across devices.

CHANGES:

1. settings.service.ts
   - Added HttpClient for API communication
   - Integrated GET and PATCH endpoints for settings
   - Removed all localStorage functionality (100% database-backed)
   - Added auto-save on every change (no manual save needed)
   - Added data mapping between frontend and backend formats
   - Added loading and error state signals
   - Settings load from API on app init
   - Sound type mapping: bell/chime/digital/soft <-> BELL/CHYME/DIGITAL_BEEP/SOFT_DING

2. settings.html
   - Removed "Save changes" button
   - Removed success modal
   - Settings now auto-save on change

3. settings.ts
   - Removed onSaveChanges() method
   - Removed onCloseSuccessModal() method
   - Removed showSuccessModal signal
   - Simplified clear data confirmations

BACKEND:
   - No changes required
   - API already exists at https://api.pomodify.site/api/v1/settings
   - Endpoints: GET /settings, PATCH /settings

DATA FLOW:
   Before: User updates → localStorage only → Lost on browser clear
   After: User updates → API (database) → Persistent across devices

BENEFITS:
   - Cross-device sync
   - 100% persistent in database
   - Auto-save (no button needed)
   - Non-blocking API calls
   - No localStorage dependency

TESTING:
   - Login to app
   - Settings load from API (check Network tab)
   - Change settings → auto-saves to API
   - Refresh page → settings persist
   - No "Save changes" button visible
   - Settings sync across devices
